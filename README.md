# Yelp Businesses 

![](Pres_first_page.png)

This is a project affiliated with the University of Chicago's Applied Data Science Program. In this project, we:

- Aimed to develop PySpark-based solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), covering a sentiment analysis model to improve restaurant services by understanding unlabeled short reviews (tips) and a personalized recommender system tailored for users
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using BigQuery and Spark SQL on a 5GB yelp Json dataset, revealing valuable insights across business, reviews, users, and tips
- Leveraged sentiment analysis using NLP pipelines and classification models to predict sentiment polarity in tip text data based on a trained dataset of 4.72M Yelp reviews. Achieved an accuracy of 0.8978 with LinearSVC after comparing various models and performing hyperparameter tuning
- Bulit a Collaborative Filtering recommender system with PySpark ALS, suggesting the top 10 restaurants for users and achieving an RMSE of 0.47. Evaluated alignment between Top 10 Recommendations' category word clouds and users' past visits preferences, affirming positive validation alongside RMSE assessment
